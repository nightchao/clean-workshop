- PurchaseRequest class
- PurchaseRequest class with create method
- Domain requirement:
    - > 100,000 THB must be approved by Senior Management
    - < 100,000 THB can be approved by both Senior and mid-level management
- Employee → Add Level method
    - Steve is mid-level management “steve@microapplesoft.com”
    - Mark is senior management “mark@microapplesoft.com”
    - Others are just employee
